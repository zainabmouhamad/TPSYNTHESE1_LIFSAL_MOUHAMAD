Introduction:
This project involves creating a micro-shell called enseash, which lets users run commands interactively and displays information about their execution.
The project is divided into several steps, with each feature to be developed sequentially.
The goal of this project is to understand the basic operations of a shell, such as displaying a prompt, reading user input, executing system commands, and handling simple interactions with the operating system.

Question 1 :

Question 2:

Question 3:

Question 4:
The shell displays the exit status or signal of the last command in the prompt. If the command runs successfully, it shows exit:0, indicating no errors. If the command is terminated by a signal, such as a forceful stop, it shows sign:9, which represents the signal that caused the termination. This gives feedback about whether the command completed normally or was interrupted.
We will use
